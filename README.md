# Curriculum Vitae

Hello,
my name is Inna Dmiterko. Here I would like to introduce myself briefly.

I came to Germany a few years ago. Since then, I have successfully completed the University of Hamburg in the field of social economics with a focus on marketing and gained professional experience at several large companies in Munich. These include BMW, Amazon, Spinmaster and Siemens IoT. 

As I am very interested in markets, people, data, figures and their interpretation, I recently discovered the exciting field of *Data Analysis & Data Science* for myself and I want to develop further in this direction. 

During the pandemic in the last few months, I have therefore completed various online courses:

- [x] Microsoft PowerBI - The complete introduction from A-Z (incl. DAX)
- [x] Complete SQL Masterclass - Fast & Easy to the pro (Python, PostgreSQL)
- [x] Data Science, Apache Spark & Python (Big Data)

see also my [(certificates)](https://github.com/winterinna/curriculum_vitae/blob/master/Zertifikate.pdf)

and actually I am doing the Machine Learning part of 

- [ ] Python for Data Science, Machine Learning & Visualisation

In addition to these online courses I use the platform "Kaggle" for practice. This platform offers numerous and varied interesting exercises on different cases and supports me in expanding what I have learned with real cases and consolidating my knowledge.
